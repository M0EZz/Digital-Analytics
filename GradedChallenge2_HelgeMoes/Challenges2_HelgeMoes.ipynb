    "\n",
    "**Name: Helge Moes**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student Number: 11348801**\n",

    "Now that we've seen how Python works and and how to use Pandas, it's time for you to combine and apply this knowledge to analyse Twitter data on your selected organisation or topic. In this challenge, you will work with the Twitter data and will execute all the steps necessary for visualising answers to a simple research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge consists of three components:\n",
    "1. **Programming**\n",
    "2. **Interpretation**\n",
    "3. **Reflection**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some important notes for the challenges:**\n",
    "1. While we of course like when you get all the answers right, the important thing is to exercise and apply the knowledge. So we will give some credit for challenges that may not be complete, as long as we see enough effort. The rubric (see Canvas) reflects this.\n",
    "2. You will deliver the challenges on Canvas. Make sure to follow the turning-in instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage of AI-generated content\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with the course policies, it is **not allowed** to use AI-generated content to any explanations or text provided in MarkDown. This means that for **Interpretation** and **Reflection** students are **not allowed** to use any AI-generated content or AI-assisted tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "For **Programming**, however, AI-assisted tools (e.g., GitHub Co-Pilot or ChatGPT) may be helpful to understand how to solve some of the questions - as one may also use Google to search for solutions online (e.g., on StackOverflow or other websites). They can, therefore, be used for the programming part of this challenge exceptionally - and only for this part - unless otherwise noted in the question. It is however your responsibility to test and make sure that the solution works - and explain this, in your own words, in the interpretation section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Facing issues? \n",
    "\n",
    "We are constantly monitoring the issues on the GitHub to help you out. Don't hesitate to log an issue there, explaining well what the problem is, showing the code you are using, and the error message you may be receiving. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** We are only monitoring the repository in weekdays, from 9.30 to 17.00. Issues logged after this time will most likely be answered the next day. This means you should not wait for our response before submitting a challenge :-)"

    "## Programming challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use an actual Twitter data. To do so, you need to:\n",
    "* Use the Twitter data available on OneDrive. \n",
    "* Use sentiment analysis file available on OneDrive\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this challenge is to propose and visualize the answer to a RQ that takes sentiment as the dependent variable and some information about your tweets as independent variable. To be able to visualize the answer, you will need to take a number of steps described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Propose a research question that has **sentiment** as dependent variable and some **categorization of your tweets** as independent variable. **Make sure to write down the RQ in your submission**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The categorization needs to be meaningful for sentiment of tweets. It can be based on any available information in your data. You will need to create the categories in one of the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load your Twitter dataset and the dataset with sentiment scores of your tweets.\n",
    "2. Minimize and pseudonymize your Twitter dataset. *Tip: to minimize it, think what variable are necessary for you to answer your RQ.*\n",
    "3. Merge your tweets dataset with sentiment so that you have a sentiment score for each tweet. *Tip: Check if the length of the dataframe generated by the merge makes sense.*\n",
    "4. Create one variable that operationalizes the sentiment of tweets (i.e., that somehow aggregates the information of it being positive or negative - or potentially neutral - into one single variable).\n",
    "5. Write a function that categorizes your tweets. Apply this function to your data.\n",
    "    * The function can use Natural Language Processing (and categorize them based on the content of the tweets) or other rules (for example, categorize tweets based on engagement, authors etc.). \n",
    "    * The categorization can be binary (taking the value 0 (when the tweet is not of that category) or 1 (when the tweet is of that category) or categorical with multiple meaningful categories that a tweet can fall under, but needs to contain meaningful information about the tweets. \n",
    "6. Calculate the reliability of the sentiment analysis **or** of the category created on step 5. To do so, you will need to:\n",
    "    1. Export a random sample of (at least) 50 tweets to Excel\n",
    "    2. Manually code this random sample for sentiment **or** for the category created on step 5\n",
    "    3. Load the manually coded data on Pandas\n",
    "    4. Merge the manual coding you did with the automated categorization (steps 4 and 5)\n",
    "    5. Calculate intercoder reliability between your coding, and the automated categorization\n",
    "7. Visualise and provide descriptive statistics to answer your RQ: \n",
    "    1. Show descriptive statistics for the IV (categorical variable) and the DV (sentiment)\n",
    "    2. Create one univariate visualisation for the IV\n",
    "    3. Create one univariate visualisation for the DV\n",
    "    4. Create one bivariate visualisation with the IV and DV in the same chart\n",
    "    5. Show the descriptives of the DV grouped by the IV and interpret them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using MarkDown\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to combine code and markdown to answer these questions. Mention specifically the question (and question number) and the answer in markdown, relating to the code and the output of the code. Failing to do will impact the grade, as we will not be able to see whether you answered the question.\n",

    "\n",
    "This code defines a function named `caps_cat` that categorizes the use of capslock in a given text input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function categorizes the capslock use in a text into three categories: low, medium, and high, based on predefined thresholds as a percentage of the total character count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Counting the total number of characters:**\n",
    "   - `count_char = len(text)` calculates the total number of characters in the input text and assigns it to the variable `count_char`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Counting the total number of characters that are in capslock:**\n",
    "   - `caps_count = sum(1 for char in text if char.isupper())` counts the number of characters in the input text that are in uppercase (capslock) and assigns it to the variable `caps_count`.\n",
    "   - It uses a generator expression along with the `sum()` function to count the characters in capslock. The generator expression iterates over each character in the text and checks if it is uppercase using the `.isupper()` method.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Defining thresholds:**\n",
    "   - `high_threshold = count_char * 0.5` defines a threshold value for high capslock use as 50% of the total character count.\n",
    "   - `low_threshold = count_char * 0.1` defines a threshold value for low capslock use as 10% of the total character count.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Categorizing the caps_count:**\n",
    "   - The function categorizes the `caps_count` based on the defined thresholds:\n",
    "     - If the `caps_count` is less than the `low_threshold`, it returns 'low'.\n",
    "     - If the `caps_count` is between the `low_threshold` and `high_threshold`, it returns 'medium'.\n",
    "     - If the `caps_count` is equal to or greater than the `high_threshold`, it returns 'high'."

    "The majority of tweets exhibit either medium or low capslock usage. Across all categories, sentiment scores tend to be more positive than negative. A linear trend can be observed, since the average sentiment score becomes more positive and the number of uppercase characters increases. Based on this exploration, we can deduce that capslock is predominantly employed to convey positive sentiments rather than negative ones. Therefore, answering the research question that the use of CAPSLOCK does correlate with the sentiment of the tweet."

    "For me, coding starts with understanding what the objective is. In this case, it is to explore the use of capslock in tweets on sentiment. To realize this, I primarily utilized resources from the course's GitHub repository, solutions of the Weekly Challenges, the online book authored by van Arila et al. (2022), and relied on internet searches for specific processes and function usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "I found it difficult to conceive a challenge and finding two datasets in the [One Drive](https://amsuni-my.sharepoint.com/personal/t_b_araujo_uva_nl/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Ft%5Fb%5Faraujo%5Fuva%5Fnl%2FDocuments%2FTeaching%2FDigitalAnalytics%2FDA2324s1%2FStudent%5Ffiles&ga=1) that would be interesting to explore. To get inspiration, I would go on YouTube and look for data projects that have done sentiment analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to challenge 1, much of the process involved trial-and-error. Consequently, I would frequently verify the code's behavior using functions like `print()` and `head()` to ensure it aligned with my intentions and the objective. I also found the \"Restart & Run All\" option helpful for maintaining the correct cell order and observing whether any alterations in the data are reflected in later cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, finding the suitable visualization seemed to be more challenging than initially thought. During this process, I would keep in mind what was taught in [DA4](https://canvas.uva.nl/courses/43716/files/10465703?module_item_id=1984234). I became more critical of my plots and whether it told the story of the results effectively. In my opinion, a graph needs little to no explanation and the reader needs to be able to understand the results purely from the plot. Based on my visualizations, I feel that my attempts were successful.\n",

    "\n",
    "Firstly, an essential method utilized in this particular challenge is `.apply()`, especially in: `final_df = merged_df[[\"positive\", \"negative\", \"neutral\"]].apply(pd.to_numeric)`. This function facilitates the application of a method that changes a data type (in this case numeric) across an entire data frame or specific columns. Without this specific code, the numeric remained being presented as strings or another non-numeric format, which would make answering the questions after Question 4 considerably more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, to explore the sentiment in the tweets, an additional dataset containing the sentiments needed to be merged with the Google dataset. Therefore, aligning the data types, lengths of tweets and sentiment scores is crucial for effective dataset merging. Verifying the lengths of datasets prevents data loss during merging, and examining column data types ensures compatibility. Additionally, performing the merge operation with an inner join ensures the intersection of keys from both frames using the `merge()` function. Checking the resulting `merged_df` length confirms successful merging, which was expected to contain the total number of tweets: 8411.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, an important step in the code involves pseudonimizing the data by removing all original `id` values. This ensures data privacy and protect sensitive information involving personal identifiable data. To enhance privacy, the `text` column is pseudonimized by replacing Twitter mentions (strings starting with '@') with '@user'. This is achieved using regular expressions and the `.replace()` method from [11_DataPrivacy](https://github.com/uva-cw-digitalanalytics/2324s2/blob/main/3_DA3/11_DataPrivacy.ipynb). Moreover `.reset_index()` and `rename()` were crucial to assign new `id` values to each tweet to make them unidentifiable.\n",

    "In general, if someone else wants to replicate or verify whether the code in this Notebook worked, I would advice to avoid hardcoding values. For instance, refrain from specifying system-specific file paths directly within functions like `pd.read_` or `pd.to_`, which load and save files to the working directory (where the Markdown file resides). Additionally, maintaining the order of cells is fundamental. After making changes, it is important to always save them and rerun the entire Kernel to prevent referencing undefined variables or data frames resulting from cell rearrangements. Moreover, when certain code commands require additional libraries not installed by default, such as `krippendorff`, it is important to install these libraries. Lastly, I would recommend to ensure that all relevant lines of code are properly annotated either using markdown or in-line comments `#` to enhance readability and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this specific challenge, it is also worth noting that checking the code manually is important, since some tweets are not fully transferred in the datasets that were used in this challenge, which possibly affected the intercoder reliability and outcome of the analysis.  Consequently, the Krippendorff's alpha score of 0.753 suggests a moderate level of agreement among the coders. While this indicates a notable level of intercoder reliability beyond chance, there is still room for improvement in the ratings' reliability. Besides the Krippendorff's alpha, the merging of the datasets were an integral aspect of this challenge. Merging can lead to missing values, which could effect the data output. Therefore, checking the quality of the merging with `missing_values = merged_df.isna().sum()` confirms a successful merging.\n",

    "\n",
    "Social media data presents more information than we initially perceive. Although publicly available, data that can be retrieved from comments and likes can hold ethical dilemmas, including concerns about privacy and informed consent. When users decide to use social media, they never assume that their information, however trivial it may seem, might be used against their favor by third parties. Therefore, the user should be aware of the fact that once the data is created, it may outlive the creator, which may lead to unforeseen repercussions (Tucker, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "This “data persistence” (Tucker, 2019, p. 426) implies that social media data, which has been collected for one purpose, might be repurposed for unintended uses, posing risks to individuals whose data is involved. Despite the fact that researchers may have good intentions, careless handling of data can result in privacy breaches or biased treatment by classification algorithms (Tucker, 2019). In the case of this challenge, I collected data for a sentiment analysis for this specific challenge. However, without properly anonymizing and pseudonymizing the data, it could potentially be repurposed to infer information about individuals based on their tweets, possibly associating them with unintended groups or worse: causing harm and (online) abuse when published. This is referred to as \"data repurposing\" (Tucker, 2019, p. 423).\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it comes as no surprise that social media companies recognize the potential of the social media data for their business value (Culnan et al., 2010). Consequently, these companies leverage user data and metadata to analyze digital footprints for their own benefit. This entails extracting: demographic attributes and political orientation without users being aware of this (Hinds & Joinson, 2018). An example of how data has been repurposed is the Scandal of Cambridge Analytica in 2018 (Hinds et al., 2020). It was revealed that the political consulting firm collected personal data from millions of Facebook users without their consent. This data was then used for political advertising during the elections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding on repurposing data, Tucker (2019) also highlights the concept of \"data spillovers\" (p. 423), where analysts using datasets may accidentally expose identifiable information, such as `id` or `author_id`. This potentially leads to traceability, privacy breaches or other negative consequences for users. Therefore, researchers must adhere to the DEDA Worksheet and exercise caution throughout the analysis process (Franzke, Muis, & Schäfer, 2021). The Data Ethics Decision Aid framework is specifically designed to moderate and advance these responsible data practices as well as creating awareness of ethical issues (Franzke, Muis, & Schäfer, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Tucker's (2019) highlighting of privacy concerns, particularly the potential risk of compromising individual privacy through predictive models, not only emphasizes the necessity of treating information with great care but also creates an awareness for the user to be mindful of what is presented on social media. The key of using this valuable resource is to balance between transparency and privacy to the extent that the individuals' information is safeguarded. Since the harm caused by these mistakes are irreversible, it is integral to remain cautious throughout the data analysis process.\n",
