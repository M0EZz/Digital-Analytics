u0JS26tiRCA,that determination to take on any
u0JS26tiRCA,challenge the desire to win at all costs
u0JS26tiRCA,the honor to fight for what is Right
u0JS26tiRCA,unfortunately most people live their
u0JS26tiRCA,life in a cowardly way they hide their
u0JS26tiRCA,Warrior spirit for fear of judgment
u0JS26tiRCA,they hide the warrior for fear of defeat
u0JS26tiRCA,they don't stand up for what is right
u0JS26tiRCA,they back down and power from every
u0JS26tiRCA,challenge life throws their way they are
u0JS26tiRCA,uninspired unmotivated and lack
u0JS26tiRCA,conviction Warriors are certain about
u0JS26tiRCA,the direction they are going in life
u0JS26tiRCA,they don't look around to others to make
u0JS26tiRCA,sure they're on the right path they know
u0JS26tiRCA,they are on the right path
u0JS26tiRCA,the warrior says I can't I will and I
u0JS26tiRCA,must there's zero hesitation in the
u0JS26tiRCA,Warriors
u0JS26tiRCA,it's all in or not in at home
u0JS26tiRCA,the warrior says I have a clear goal I
u0JS26tiRCA,have a clear Mission I have a meaningful
u0JS26tiRCA,purpose I believe in myself I will give
u0JS26tiRCA,all I have for this goal dismiss my

u0JS26tiRCA,defeated I will not be defeat
u0JS26tiRCA,there's a famous story of a grandfather
u0JS26tiRCA,who is teaching his grandson about life
u0JS26tiRCA,and the fight we all have within he
u0JS26tiRCA,tells the boy there's a fight going on
u0JS26tiRCA,inside me a fight between two wolves one
u0JS26tiRCA,wolf is evil
u0JS26tiRCA,disguise as uncontrolled anger cowardice
u0JS26tiRCA,bitterness self-pity
u0JS26tiRCA,inferiority false pride and
u0JS26tiRCA,one wolf is good he is represented as
u0JS26tiRCA,Focus belief presence love joy honor
u0JS26tiRCA,dignity and integrity
u0JS26tiRCA,he says to the boy the same fight is
u0JS26tiRCA,going on inside you boy and inside every
u0JS26tiRCA,other person on this planet the boy
u0JS26tiRCA,asked which wolf will win the
u0JS26tiRCA,grandfather replies the one you feed the
u0JS26tiRCA,most
u0JS26tiRCA,we all have the coward and the Warrior
u0JS26tiRCA,inside us what you see most is what you
u0JS26tiRCA,feed most we all have moments of doubt
u0JS26tiRCA,we all have fears we all have moments of
u0JS26tiRCA,Shame and disappointment but we all have
u0JS26tiRCA,that Warrior inside us
u0JS26tiRCA,the good energy the protector of the
u0JS26tiRCA,truth the honor to stand for what is
u0JS26tiRCA,right the Integrity to fight for the
u0JS26tiRCA,good of all the warrior doesn't always
u0JS26tiRCA,win but he will always fight with
u0JS26tiRCA,everything he has until his last breath
u0JS26tiRCA,the coward doesn't believe they can
u0JS26tiRCA,defeat the evil forces so they don't
u0JS26tiRCA,even try therefore they lose the battle
u0JS26tiRCA,every time the warrior will fight for
u0JS26tiRCA,what is right no matter the eyes no
u0JS26tiRCA,matter the potential consequences
u0JS26tiRCA,the warrior says it is not over until I
u0JS26tiRCA,say so and it is never over because I
u0JS26tiRCA,will never quit you have that warrior
u0JS26tiRCA,with these it's a mindset your mind is

u0JS26tiRCA,Paving your own path and walking in the
u0JS26tiRCA,direction you know to be right
u0JS26tiRCA,no matter what challenges life throws my
u0JS26tiRCA,way I know I can handle this God would
u0JS26tiRCA,not give me challenges I could not
u0JS26tiRCA,handle this moment is a test and the
u0JS26tiRCA,test I will pass I will die before I
u0JS26tiRCA,give up I will die before I give in I am
u0JS26tiRCA,committed to my goal and I will not

xa07OaZcWGM,long enough to see me down
xa07OaZcWGM,[Music]
xa07OaZcWGM,long enough to see me
xa07OaZcWGM,if I ever come down I'll be falling on
xa07OaZcWGM,the soil today I had a conversation with
xa07OaZcWGM,one of my Bros my homie he's been close
xa07OaZcWGM,to me since we were six years old he
xa07OaZcWGM,caused my mom a mom he's seen all of my
xa07OaZcWGM,highs and lows from school fights to
xa07OaZcWGM,sharing clothes from b-ball to
xa07OaZcWGM,hoes he sat me down to let me know some
xa07OaZcWGM,things he never told me things he never
xa07OaZcWGM,got a chance to say or even show me he
xa07OaZcWGM,said I know that I don't tell you often
xa07OaZcWGM,maybe not even at all but I'm so proud
xa07OaZcWGM,of you and your success Broski and I
xa07OaZcWGM,admire how you chase your dreams that's
xa07OaZcWGM,just courageous thank you for never
xa07OaZcWGM,switching up when you got rich and
xa07OaZcWGM,famous thank you for never giving up on
xa07OaZcWGM,me or having lesser love for me whenever
xa07OaZcWGM,we lose touch and be on different pages
xa07OaZcWGM,I hope you know I'm here for you the way
xa07OaZcWGM,you there for me it's crazy you've done
xa07OaZcWGM,more for me than on my family tree and
xa07OaZcWGM,when I say I got your badges no I really
xa07OaZcWGM,squeeze and make some really
xa07OaZcWGM,bleed that's really what I really mean
xa07OaZcWGM,I'm proud of how much human chart and
xa07OaZcWGM,grew but you still you the world knows
xa07OaZcWGM,you for your talent but I know the real
xa07OaZcWGM,you and all your traumas behind closed
xa07OaZcWGM,doors you never held through and all the
xa07OaZcWGM,pain you act like you don't fail but you
xa07OaZcWGM,still do I love the fact you keep your
xa07OaZcWGM, together mentally you work hard for
xa07OaZcWGM,your respect don't need no empathy when
xa07OaZcWGM,people look you over and shut you out
xa07OaZcWGM,intentionally you always said if they
xa07OaZcWGM,don't with you they will eventually
xa07OaZcWGM,and remember when I went to prison when
xa07OaZcWGM,I did a bid and you the only one I came
xa07OaZcWGM,to visit put money on my books and sent
xa07OaZcWGM,me pictures of some they don't
xa07OaZcWGM,make them like you no more my you
xa07OaZcWGM,just different and bro you ain't have to
xa07OaZcWGM,pay my niece's tuition or set me up with
xa07OaZcWGM,that new job and try to teach me the
xa07OaZcWGM,business always quick to hold me down
xa07OaZcWGM,before you speak your opinion what goes
xa07OaZcWGM,around comes around and that's the
xa07OaZcWGM,reason you win it but listen I was
xa07OaZcWGM,thinking maybe since you're my Broski
xa07OaZcWGM,and I've been there since we was babies
xa07OaZcWGM,you can hit the bank and break me off
xa07OaZcWGM,with something wavy maybe just a couple
xa07OaZcWGM,hundred thousand nothing crazy cause
xa07OaZcWGM,I've been hurting lately and I deserve
xa07OaZcWGM,it maybe and if you can't do it that's
xa07OaZcWGM,cool it ain't like I'll be angry you
xa07OaZcWGM,still my bro skin I love you but that's
xa07OaZcWGM,kind of shady cause I've been going
xa07OaZcWGM,through some today I'm just lazy so
xa07OaZcWGM,maybe you should pay me I quit my job
xa07OaZcWGM,because I don't want to work for no
xa07OaZcWGM,other well maybe works for some
xa07OaZcWGM,don't work for some other yeah
xa07OaZcWGM,they pay good but you know I'm a
xa07OaZcWGM,stubborn plus I know you got my
xa07OaZcWGM,back right right
xa07OaZcWGM,if not then it I ain't asking again
xa07OaZcWGM,just don't forget who walk with you when
xa07OaZcWGM,you're back to the win and don't forget
xa07OaZcWGM,whose ideas I got you rapping again when
xa07OaZcWGM,you lost your passion and got lazy and
xa07OaZcWGM,was slacking and then please don't
xa07OaZcWGM,treat me like them that be asking
xa07OaZcWGM,for cause I never asked you for a
xa07OaZcWGM,damn thing I'd rather pull a hamstring
xa07OaZcWGM,and run across some fan blades while
xa07OaZcWGM,jumping out an airplane or sitting in a
xa07OaZcWGM,damn rain while begging for some spare
xa07OaZcWGM,change I'm sorry that we all can't be
xa07OaZcWGM,talented and Rich like you the little
xa07OaZcWGM,people still struggle we ain't lit like
xa07OaZcWGM,you and if we being honest they don't
xa07OaZcWGM,really seem like you want me to Chase my
xa07OaZcWGM,dreams so I can get like you and lately
xa07OaZcWGM,you've been on some sucking that's
xa07OaZcWGM,what I see Bros I hope you know that
xa07OaZcWGM,hater is a disease brosie cause
xa07OaZcWGM,last time I checked we was a
xa07OaZcWGM,team and just because you got paper
