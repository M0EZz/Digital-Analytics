Beberapa waktu lalu mengeluarkan lagu baru bertajuk ""Sial"" hingga kini menjadi lagu viral di sosial media. Lagu Sial adalah salah satu single dari Album terbaru Mahalini yang berjudul ""Fabula"" yang juga terdapat single Bohongi Hati, Melawan Restu, Sisa Rasa, dan Kisah Sempurna. Bentuk terimakasih mahalini ke pendengar album fabula, kali ini mahalini mengajak pendengarnya untuk terlibat dalam music video sial. Dari banyaknya cerita yang masuk ke kami, ada 4 kisah true story yang kami ambil untuk mewakili cerita Lagu Sial di dalam musik video ini. Semoga bisa mewakili perasaan kalian yang mendengar lagu Sial Story by : Marsha Zuleika Cindy Hubbard Haaru Erina Jayanti Ceritakan kisahmu dikolom comment! Lagu 'Sial' bercerita tentang kekesalan, penyesalan, dan rasa sakit karena mencintai orang yang salah. Lagu ini juga menggambarkan bagaimana orang yang ditinggal tanpa alasan bertanya-tanya tentang dirinya sendiri, bagaimana mereka bisa membuat keputusan yang salah dalam mencintai. Lagu Sial ini jadi gambaran tentang ghosting yang dilakukan oleh orang-orang yang tidak berani menghadapi konsekuensi. Sudah siapkah kalian bergalau ria dengan Mahalini Listen on all music platforms:  ================================================ Lirik Lagu Mahalini Sial Sampai saat ini tak terpikir olehku Aku pernah beri rasa pada orang sepertimu Seandainya sejak awa tak ku yakinkan diriku Tutur kata yang sempurna, tak sebaik yang kukira Andai kutahu semua akan sia-sia Takkan ku terima cinta sesaatmu Bagaimana dengan aku Terlanjur mencintaimu Yang datang beri harapan lalu pergi dan menghilang Tak terfikirkan olehmu Hatiku hancur karena mu Tanpa sedikit alasan Pergi tanpa berpamitan Takkan kuterima cinta sesaatmu Seandainya sejak awal tak ku yakinkan diriku Tutur kata yang sempurna, tak sebaik yang kukira Andai kutahu semua akan sia-sia Takkan ku terima cinta sesaatmu Bagaimana dengan aku Terlanjur mencintaimu Yang datang beri harapan Lalu pergi dan menghilang Tak terfikirkan olehmu Hatiku hancur karena mu Tanpa sedikit alasan Pergi tanpa berpamitan Takkan kuterima cinta sesaatmu Sial, sialnya ku bertemu dengan cinta semu Tertipu tutur dan caramu, seolah cintaiku Puas kau curangi aku? Bagaimana dengan aku Terlanjur mencintaimu Yang datang beri harapan Lalu pergi dan menghilang Tak terfikirkan olehmu Hatiku hancur karena mu Tanpa sedikit alasan Pergi tanpa berpamitan Takkan kuterima cinta sesaatmu ======================================== Mahalini – Sial Executive producer : Lina Priscilla for Hits Records A&R : Sevri Hadis A&R Assistant : Rafael Yefta Audio Credits Written by : Andmesh Kamaleng, Mahalini & Mohammed Kamga Composed by : Andmesh kamaleng, Mahalini & Mohammed Kamga Produced by : Adrian Rahmat Purwanto Piano, Synth, Bass by: Adrian Rahmat Purwanto Vocals Directed by : Mohammed Kamga Vocals Recorded by : Aditya Bagus at Backbeat Studios Vocal Edited by : Rio Ndul Mixed by : Hery Alesis Mastered by : Dimas Pradipta Publisher : PT.

my homie hes been close to me since we were six years old he caused my mom a mom hes seen all of my highs and lows from school fights to sharing clothes from bball to hoes he sat me down to let me know some things he never told me things he never got a chance to say or even show me he said i know that i dont tell you often maybe not even at all but im so proud of you and your success broski and i admire how you chase your dreams thats just courageous thank you for never switching up when you got rich and famous thank you for never giving up on me or having lesser love for me whenever we lose touch and be on different pages i hope you know im here for you the way you there for me its crazy youve done more for me than on my family tree and when i say i got your badges no i really squeeze and make some really bleed thats really what i really mean im proud of how much human chart and grew but you still you the world knows you for your talent but i know the real you and all your traumas behind closed doors you never held through and all the pain you act like you dont fail but you still do i love the fact you keep your together mentally you work hard for your respect dont need no empathy when people look you over and shut you out intentionally you always said if they dont with you they will eventually and remember when i went to prison when i did a bid and you the only one i came to visit put money on my books and sent me pictures of some they dont make them like you no more my you just different and bro you aint have to pay my nieces tuition or set me up with that new job and try to teach me the business always quick to hold me down before you speak your opinion what goes around comes around and thats the reason you win it but listen i was thinking maybe since youre my broski and ive been there since we was babies you can hit the bank and break me off with something wavy maybe just a couple hundred thousand nothing crazy cause ive been hurting lately and i deserve it maybe and if you cant do it thats cool it aint like ill be angry you still my bro skin i love you but thats kind of shady cause ive been going through some today im just lazy so maybe you should pay me i quit my job because i dont want to work for no other well maybe works for some dont work for some other yeah they pay good but you know im a stubborn plus i know you got my back right right if not then it i aint asking again just dont forget who walk with you when youre back to the win and dont forget whose ideas i got you rapping again when you lost your passion and got lazy and was slacking and then please dont treat me like them that be asking for cause i never asked you for a damn thing id rather pull a hamstring and run across some fan blades while jumping out an airplane or sitting in a damn rain while begging for some spare change im sorry that we all cant be talented and rich like you the little people still struggle we aint lit like you and if we being honest they dont really seem like you want me to chase my dreams so i can get like you and lately youve been on some sucking thats what i see bros i hope you know that hater is a disease brosie cause last time i checked we was a team and just because you got paper dont mean that you better than me broski i know everything about you i know every single seat i know where you rest your head at i know every you sleep with i know where you keep your bread at i pretend that i dont see you a gritty youve been hoping i dont be youve been getting fat stuff youve been buying every car and house for lobbing in the garbage i deserve everything you got it more and thats a bargain you just want to on me and see me falling thats alarming you just hoping im a tarnish you dont want me to be nothing you dont want to open doors with me you did a little something but you could have did a little more for me no wonder why your father turned his back on you unfortunately no wonder why your set them traps and you the sorcery you aint nothing but a phony you a liar you a stick and you can rap and joint kendrick you aint cold you aint drink cant believe i called you family i should shoot you in the face you sound
